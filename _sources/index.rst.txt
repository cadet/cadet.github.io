CADET
=====

The Chromatography Analysis and Design Toolkit (CADET) is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) of Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) under supervision of Dr. Eric von Lieres.
The core of the CADET software is a fast and accurate solver for the General Rate Model (GRM) of packed bed liquid chromatography.
The CADET solver covers a wide range of GRM variants, combining different transport and binding models with state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and scientific computing techniques.

Features
--------

* Fast and accurate solution of the partial differential algebraic equations (PDAE) based on the finite volume method and the WENO scheme
* Computation of derivatives with respect to model parameters by a forward sensitivity approach combined with algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* Shared memory parallelization using Intel TBB
* Native Matlab interface (MEX) with many examples for rapid development
* Modular design allows for easy experimenting with the code (e.g., adding a new binding model or unit operation)
* Supports XML and HDF5 as data formats
* Multi-platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X

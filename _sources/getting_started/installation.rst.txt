Install CADET-Python
--------------------

The easiest way to create CADET simulations is to use the `CADET-Python <https://github.com/modsim/CADET-python>`_ interface.
For this purpose, we recommend installing Anaconda.
Anaconda is a high-performance scinetific installation of Python that includes many common packages needed for scientific and engineering work.
Download the installer from their `website <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ and run it for the local user.
To install the `CADET-Python`, open an `Anaconda Shell` and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c immudzen cadet 

If you would also like to use `CADET-Match <https://github.com/modsim/CADET-Match>`_ for parameter estimation, also run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c immudzen cadetmatch

To run our examples, we recommend also installing the following packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install jupyterlab scipy matplotlib gitpython

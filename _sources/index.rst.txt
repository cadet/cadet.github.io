The Chromatography Analysis and Design Toolkit (CADET) is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) of Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) under supervision of Dr. Eric von Lieres.
The core of the CADET software is a fast and accurate solver for the General Rate Model (GRM) of packed bed liquid chromatography.
The CADET solver covers a wide range of GRM variants, combining different transport and binding models with state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and scientific computing techniques.

Features
--------

* Fast and accurate solution of the partial differential algebraic equations (PDAE) based on the finite volume method and the WENO scheme
* Computation of derivatives with respect to model parameters by a forward sensitivity approach combined with algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* Shared memory parallelization using Intel TBB
* Native Matlab interface (MEX) with many examples for rapid development
* Modular design allows for easy experimenting with the code (e.g., adding a new binding model or unit operation)
* Supports XML and HDF5 as data formats
* Multi-platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X

Online Simulator
----------------

Try CADET in the browser using the `online simulator web service <http://www.cadet-web.de>`_.


Ongoing Development
-------------------

Since CADET is actively developed, do not expect a stable API. Breaking changes and extensive restructuring may occur in any commit and release. For non-developers, it is recommended to upgrade from release to release instead of always working with the most recent commit.

Bugs
----

Please report any bugs that you find `here <https://github.com/modsim/cadet/issues>`_. Or, even better, fork the repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/modsim/cadet>`_ and create a pull request (PR) with the fix. 

Donations
---------

`Donations <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=FCQ2M89558ZAG>`_ for helping to host, maintain, and further develop the CADET project are highly appreciated.
